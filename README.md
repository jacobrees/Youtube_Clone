# Youtube_Clone

We have made a cloned layout from the Youtube page, in the project is included the HTML (index.html) file and the CSS (style.css) file.

We created the navigation box, video display, comments part and the side area in wich several videos are suggested, at the final of the page we included the footer as well.

Please look at the main page of the repo, most commits were made to the master branch, however, we already know we have to work on a separated branch and keep the master branch empty
